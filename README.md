# Typing-speed-test

This project uses Tkinter for the GUI

What it does:

-it has a start button, a display for words, a word counter, and a 1-minute timer

-after the start button is pressed the user has to write the words which are being shown on the display

-the user enters the words by pressing enter and after that, he gets a new one

-after 1 minute the app shows how many words/minute the user can write
